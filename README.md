### Professional Single Page Web Site

### About the Application
This web application is designed to replace the current [Word Press site.](http://annieloupss.com) The new website is built using the powerful [React.js](reactjs.org) framework, [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for declarative routing, [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io) for ensuring the site is responsive and built with a mobile first mentality, and [React-Router-Bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-router-bootstrap) for better routing and navigation button integration.

If the website is approved by the Business Owners, website will likely be deployed on the Word Press CMS. Additional work will be required to tie in the contact form functionality to the CMS's mailer function.
